## About

We started off as an informal professional study group with the goal of expanding our knowledge and helping each other on our side projects. Eventually some of our side projects were actually quite useful and we thought other people may benefit from them.

This eventually lead to the idea of creating Prism labs. A place to showcase interesting projects as well as support each other in the development of these projects.

Today most of the projects featured here are maintained by a single developer and started off as a side project. Prism Labs operates as a collective and nothing more. We all have a passion for development and want each other to succeed!
